# Proximiio Demo

Welcome!

This is a simple working demonstration of Proximi.io platform in action on Android,
that demonstrates basic usage of Proximi.io Android SDK, usage of Proximi.io Android Maps SDK, and generic push notifications through Proximi.io.
Our complete Android SDK documentation can be found [here](https://proximi.io/docs/android/), and Android Maps SDK documentation can be found [here](https://proximi.io/docs/android-maps/).

### How to use

Clone or download this repo and open it with Android Studio as an existing project.
After that you need to replace the auth key placeholder with your own auth key (in MainActivity.java), which can be found in your portal under "Applications":

```
public static final String AUTH = "AUTH_KEY_HERE"; // TODO: Replace with your own!
```
