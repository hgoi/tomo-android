### How to use

## Installing Proximi io sdk

Clone or download this repo and open it with Android Studio as an existing project.
After that you need to replace the auth key placeholder with your own auth key (in MainActivity.java), which can be found in your portal under "Applications":

```
public static final String AUTH = "AUTH_KEY_HERE"; // TODO: Replace with your own!
```
